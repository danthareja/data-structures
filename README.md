#data-structures

This repo is a learning exercise implementing the following basic data structures: stack, queue, linked list, set, tree, binary search tree, hash table, binary search tree and graph.

This is a copy of the work I did on a private repo, originally a project from
[Hack Reactor's](http://hackreactor.com) curriculum. This project was worked
on with a pair; it's representative of the kind of problems that I've tackled,
but not of my solo work.
